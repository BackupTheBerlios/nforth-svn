<h1>Introduction</h1>

<a name="whatisforth"></a>
<h2>What is Forth?</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth">Forth</a> is a unique in many
aspects programming language which is usually placed somewhere between
low-level programming languages (assembly, byte-code etc) and high-level
programming languages such as C, Pascal, BASIC and others.
Its unique features are small program footprint (often Forth programs will
be smaller than even those written in assembly), good execution speed
(comparable to languages which compile to byte-code) and low hardware
requirements (a complete Forth kernel may be coded in a few tens
of kilobytes on a typical modern machine).
</p>

<p>A specific feature of Forth is its use of the so-called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">
reverse Polish notation (RPN)</a> for everythig.
Those, who are familiar with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-48_series">Hewlett-Packard
RPN calculators</a>, or with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektronika_MK-61">old Soviet
RPN calculators</a> will know what I mean. For those who don't,
I would recommend to read the article in Wikipedia about RPN
(by following the link above).
</p>

<p>Some of the most notable features of Forth (in no specific order):
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)</li>
<li>Forth has no type checking (here it is similar to assembly)</li>
<li>The biggest part of a Forth kernel is usually written in Forth itself</li>
<li>Interactive immediate interpretation or compilation of the code you enter</li>
<li>Very extensible and flexible: you can add new keywords and even flow control
constructs on the fly!</li>
<li>Lots, no - LOTS - of implementations, including freeware. Perhaps, Forth
has the most numerous number of implementations amongst all programming languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Forth is relatively widely used, although this is not very widely known.
For example, the well-known PostScript language is, in fact, a Forth dialect
(with graphics-specific extensions). Also, it is used as the language of the
boot loader (what's called "BIOS" on PCs) on several architectures: SPARC,
PowerPC, OLPC (one-laptop-per-child project).
<p>

<p>There are even several microprocessors which use Forth as their low-level
language (e.g. Forth is their assembly language).</p>

<p>The author of Forth is <a href="http://www.colorforth.com/">Charles H. Moore</a>,
who developed it since 1958 initially for controlling a telescope system.

<h2>Why nForth?</h2>

<p>nForth is yet another Forth implementation which has been specifically
optimized for very small computers (microcontrollers). The nForth kernel
is as small as 4k (and can be made much smaller if you don't need the
interactive session capabilities), can work with as little as 128 bytes
of RAM and needs some EEPROM memory to store user-defined words (the more you
have, the better for end user).
</p>

<p>The name nForth is short for "nano-Forth". The "nano-" prefix was
chosen because the name micro-Forth is already taken by another Forth
implementation :-) Another reason was that the primary target was to
create a very small (but still enough for any task) Forth implementation.
Thus, no Forth standards were taken as a base; instead, I started from
an almost empty dictionary and then have added the words that were
absolutely neccessary for implementing the nForth kernel itself.
The idea is that if this dictionary is enough for implementing a
working Forth kernel, it should be enough for most tasks as well.
</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of microcontrollers is their so-calld Harvard
architecture. Every type of memory (RAM, ROM (flash), EEPROM) use a separate
address space, unlike the conventional computer architecture (which is called
"von Neumann architecture") with a single flat address space. nForth
has been primarily designed for machines with Harvard architecture.
</p>

<p>Why the need of nForth on microcontrollers? Sometimes you need to make
a intelligent hardware device which behaviour can be modified by the end
user. Of course, you can re-flash your microcontroller every time, but this
means the end-user will have to know everything about the internals of the
device; it would be useful to have some relatively high-level scripting
language which can access all features of the device, but at the same time
doesn't expose low-level details about the inner workings.
</p>

<p>Examples of such usage are: programmable battery chargers, simple robots,
various measurement devices (multimeters, oscilloscopes etc), light controllers
and so on - limited by your imagination only.
</p>

<p>nForth supports up to 32 kilobytes of flash memory, and up to 32
kilobytes of summary RAM + EEPROM memory. If you need Forth on a microcontroller
with more resources, look at other Forth implementations with more features.
</p>

<p>nForth has a limited core vocabulary: this is a tradeoff for the small
kernel size. Only the words that were found absolutely needed were implemented.
Also, the implementation allows to disable usage of certain sets of words
(vocabularies) if they aren't needed for your application.
</p>

<p>Despite the fact that nForth has been designed for Harvard architecture,
still, it is possible to compile a nForth kernel for von Neumann
computers with almost no overhead compared to "normal" Forth kernels.
This is particularily useful for debugging: since nForth itself is
written in a portable manner, it can be easily compiled for traditional
personal computers so that it can be easily debugged and explored.

<h2>A primer to general Forth</h2>

<p>There are many guides for novices on Forth on the net, so I won't write
yet another bad primer; instead, I'll put here a collection of links to
some good sources of information on Forth.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.charlton.demon.co.uk/stackflow/">An Introduction to Forth
Using StackFlow</a>: this is a good guide for absolute beginners and give a good
overview of the basic Forth concepts: the stack, control flow etc.
<li><a href="http://astro.pas.rochester.edu/Forth/forth.html">An Introduction to
Forth</a>: this is a deeper tutorial for beginners which gives some more
information on Forth.
<li>The former <a href="http://www.forth.org/">Forth Interest Group</a> site
can be used as a starting point for further investigations regarding Forth.
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth">Wikipedia article about Forth</a>
is also a good source of information on Forth.
<li>There's a <a href="http://forthfreak.net/jsforth80x25.html">complete Forth
implementation written in JavaScript</a>, you can immediately try what you've
learned by previous links.</li>
