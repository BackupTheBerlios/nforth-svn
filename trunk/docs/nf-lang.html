<h1>The nForth language</h1>

<p>nForth is a 16-bit Forth kernel. This means that the stack
holds 16-bit words. A word from the stack can be anything: a number
(interpreted as signed from -32768 to +32767), a pointer to a string,
a pointer to a function etc.
</p>

<p>What you would call a 'procedure' or 'function' in traditional programming
languages in Forth is called a 'word'. nForth stores predefined words
in ROM (flash) memory, and user-defined words in EEPROM memory. Thus,
user-defined words won't be lost after a poweroff.
</p>

<p>Note that the word "word" may reference either a Forth "word" (e.g.
a subroutine) or a machine word (a 16-bit word). Most of the time I've
tried to avoid using the word "word" in the sense of "machine word"
(using "value" instead where appropiate), but sometimes still it has
to be used. Try to guess what kind of "word" is meant by context :)
</p>

<p>A set of words is called a 'vocabulary' in Forth. nForth has some
limited support for vocabularies. You may configure what vocabularies are
used by your application, thus trading functionality for core size.
Currently, a nForth context may use two dictionaries simultaneously:
the core dictionary (which contains core nForth words and the words
defined at firmware compilation time, such as application-specific words
which provide access to hardware-specific functionality) and the user
dictionary (which contains the user-defined words). These vocabularies
may be easily switched at run-time (by providing specific words in
dictionary) by simply replacing one of the pointers to active
vocabularies.
</p>

<a name="memorymap"></a>
<h2>Unified memory map</h2>

<p>There are three types of memory available on a typical MCU:

<ul>
<li>ROM (flash memory): used to store the basic (static) words.
<li>EEPROM: used to store persistent variables and user-defined words
(indirect code only, native code not supported).
<li>RAM: used to store the stacks and variables in nForth.
</ul>

<p>Word definitions can be stored in ROM and EEPROM memories.
RAM cannot be used for this; instead, RAM is used for the stack and
to store volatile variables. EEPROM memory can be also used for
persistent variables (those which don't lose their value across poweroffs).
</p>

<p>Since the Forth kernel does not know what type of memory an address
picked from the stack refers to, it was decided to unify the Forth address
space, so that a 16-bit address can be used to reference all kinds of memory
available on a typical microcontroller. So internally nForth uses
a uniform memory addressing scheme (hexadecimal values):
</p>

<ul>
<li>0000..7FFF: These addresses refer to ROM (flash memory)</li>
<li>8000..7FFF+EEPROM_SIZE: These addresses are mapped to EEPROM</li>
<li>8000+EEPROM_SIZE..7FFF+EEPROM_SIZE+RAM_SIZE: These addresses are mapped to RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>From the above scheme it's clear that a nForth kernel cannot address more
than 32k of flash memory and more than 32k of summary RAM+EEPROM. More than that,
for some reasons described later it cannot reference more than 16k of EEPROM
memory. In the following we'll call an address in this unified address space
a "unified pointer".
</p>

<a name="impdetails"></a>
<h2>Implementation details</h2>

<p>The nForth kernel keeps the whole state (including the data and return
stacks) in a structure named 'nForth context'. You may define multiple
contexts (just make sure they fit in your microcontroller RAM - a context
is a relatively big structure) and then switch between them at runtime
(cooperative or preemptive multi-tasking).
</p>

<p>Words in a vocabulary are linked in a chained list, last word points to
previous and so on, until the first word which contains '0' in the
'previous link' field. A vocabulary pointer is just a pointer to the last
word in chain. This allows for clever tricks, by using the same subset of
words in several vocabularies: the first words in vocabularies are different,
and at some point the back link is set to point to some other list, thus
effectively making it a new dictionary incorporating another dictionary.
</p>

<p>Forth uses a very simple memory allocation scheme: there's a global pointer
to the start of free memory (<b>HERE</b>). If you want to allocate some memory,
you just increment this pointer by how much you need (with <b>ALLOT</b>).
It is not possible to free up blocks of memory which are located between
other allocated blocks, you can just draw back the <b>HERE</b> pointer
(by providing a negative argument to <b>ALLOT</b>, e.g. allocating negative
amounts of memory).
</p>

<p>Usually allocation is done for new words. When user starts defining a new
word (with the : word), the kernel will allocate space for the word header
in EEPROM, and then enter compilation mode (<b>STATE</b> is set to <b>TRUE</b>).
In compilation mode any words entered by user are compiled rather than
interpreted immediately. 'Compilation' simply means that the address
of the word is appended at the end of the word definition. When a word
definition is complete you may run it with the <b>EXECUTE</b> word,
which is the core of the whole Forth kernel.
It will pick these addresses one by one and executes the words located
at those addresses. This technique is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code#Indirect_threading">
indirect threading code</a> or indirect code for short.
</p>

<p>nForth uses some special codes to make code smaller. The following
list shows the meaning of the different codes (hexadecimal values):
</p>

<ul>
<li>0000..7FFF: Execute the word at this address in ROM (flash memory)</li>
<li>8000..BFFF: Execute the word at this address-8000 in EEPROM</li>
<li>C000..C1FF: (JMP) relative jump in the range -255..+255</li>
<li>C200..C3FF: (JZ) POP and relative jump if zero in the range -255..+255</li>
<li>C400..FFFF: push on stack a numeric constant in the range -7680..+7679</li>
</ul>

<p>As you may observe, the codes in the range 0000-BFFF are basicaly uniform
pointers to either ROM or EEPROM. There are no words in RAM, thus the range
from C000 to FFFF is used for some special "built-in" functionality.
</p>

<p>Also there are two special values: 0000 is used as the indirect code for
the <b>EXIT</b> word (which marks the end of word definition, or 'return'
from word), and 0001, which is called <b>ICP</b>, will push on stack the
value of the indirect-code-pointer from the caller word (this will be
explained later).
</p>

<p>Since word definitions are placed in both ROM and EEPROM, they cannot
contain variable values directly, like traditional Forth does.
Thus, DATA words will instead contain a unified pointer to either
RAM or EEPROM.
</p>

<a name="coredict"></a>
<h2>The core dictionary</h2>

<p>For more flexibility this nForth implementation provides several
variants of the core dictionary:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>nf_voc_core</dt>
<dd>This dictionary contains only the most basic words: stack manipulation,
memory allocation, arithmetics and boolean operations, exception handling,
memory reading and writing</dd>
<dt>nf_voc_core_io</dt>
<dd>This is the core vocabulary, extended with some i/o words like
<b>EMIT</b>, <b>TYPE</b>, <b>.</b>, <b>GETC</b> and some others. If you use
this vocabulary, don't forget to call nf_init_io() at application
initialization time</dd>
<dt>nf_voc_core_inter</dt>
<dd>This is the most complete vocabulary, providing core, i/o and interactive
functionality like the words <b>INTERPRET</b>, <b>WORD</b>, <b>STATE</b>,
<b>CREATE</b>, <b>VARIABLE</b>, flow control (<b>IF</b>, <b>?DO</b>,
<b>BEGIN</b>)</dd>
</dl>

<p>In the following, the syntax of Forth words are given in traditional format,
e.g. "( x y z -- a b )" would mean that the word accepts three numbers on
the stack on input - denoted as x, y, z - and will put two results on return,
denoted as a and b.
</p>

<p>Some words may return different values depending on some conditions.
Such variants are denoted by a vertical bar, for example: "( x -- x 0 | y 1 )"
would mean that the function picks x and returns either "x 0", or "y 1"
depending on some condition.
</p>

<a name="kerncontrol"></a>
<h3>Kernel control</h3>

<dl>
<dt>RESET ( -- )</dt>

or a poweroff.</dd>
<dt>INTERPRET ( -- )</dt>

<a name="memalloc"></a>
<h3>Memory allocation</h3>

<dl>
<dt>HERE ( -- n )</dt>

<dd>Similar to <b>HERE</b>, this word will leave on top of the stack the first
unallocated address in RAM memory pool for variables. The RAM pool is also
allocated bottom-up.</dd>
<dt>PHERE ( -- n )</dt>
<dd>This will leave on stack the last allocated address in EEPROM memory pool
for persistent variables. This pool is allocated from topmost EEPROM address
down, thus you must first allocate some memory and then call <b>EHERE</b> to obtain
the address of the new memory. This is a contrast with <b>HERE</b>
and <b>DHERE</b>.</dd>

<dd>Parse user input for a space-delimited word name, then create the header
of a DATA word and put <b>VHERE</b> in word body. No memory allocation is done,
you will have to use <b>VALLOT</b> for this.</dd>
<dt>VARIABLE ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Parse user input for a space-delimited word name, then create a variable
by allocating two bytes in RAM (with <b>VALLOT</b>) and appending the uniform
pointer to allocated memory at the end of the DATA word definition.</dd>
<dt>PVARIABLE ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Similar to <b>VARIABLE</b>, but allocates 2 bytes in the persistent variable
memory pool (<b>PHERE</b>).</dd>
</dl>

<a name="memaccess"></a>
<h3>Memory access</h3>

<dd>Fetch byte: similar to @, but reads the byte value at given address</dd>
<dt>C!</dt>
<dd>Assign byte: Similar to !, but assigns the value to a single byte at
given address</dd>
<dt>DC@ ( addr -- addr val )</dt>
<dd>Equivalent to <b>DUP</b> <b>C@</b> - takes the byte value at given address
and put it on the stack, but don't remove the address from the stack. This is a
useful word when processing strings, for example</dd>

<dt>EMIT ( char -- )</dt>
<dd>Output the character from the top of the stack</dd>
<dt>TYPE ( str -- )</dt>
<dd>Display the zero-terminated string, whose address is on the top
of the stack</dd>
<dt>. ( n -- )</dt>
<dd>Display the number from the top of the stack and a space</dd>
<dt>.S</dt>
<dd>Display the whole contents of the stack</dd>
<dt>GETC ( -- n )</dt>
<dd>Reads a single character from input stream (if there are no more
characters buffered, waits until one is available)</dd>
<dt>GETCQ ( -- n )</dt>
<dd>Similar to <b>GETC</b>, but if the incoming character is '\' (backslash),
reads the next character and interpret them according to character
quoting rules (\n is translated to newline, \r to carriage return,
\t to tabulation, \b to backspace)</dd>
<dt>." ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Displays the text immediately following the word, until either another

<a name="strops"></a>
<h3>Operations with strings</h3>

<dl>
<dt>S" ( -- str )</dt>
<dd>Parse the string following the word until either a newline or a " is
encountered, and push the address of that string on the stack</dd>
<dt>SLEN ( str -- str n )</dt>
<dd>Push the length of the string on the stack; do not remove
the string address</dd>
<dt>S2N ( str -- FALSE | n TRUE )</dt>
<dd>Try to interpret the string whose address is on the top of the stack
as a number; if this succeeds, pushes the number and TRUE on the stack;
otherwise pushes just a FALSE. Always removes the string address from
the stack.</dd>
<dt>S2C ( str -- FALSE | n TRUE )</dt>
<dd>Try to interpret the string whose address is on the top of the stack
as a character in single quotes (e.g. 'a', 'Z', '\n' and so on). Handles
properly quoted characters - \n for newline, \r for carriage return
and so on</dd>
</dl>

<a name="controlflow"></a>
<h3>Control flow</h3>

<dl>
<dt>IF ... {ELSE} ... THEN ( n -- )</dt>
<dd>Check the topmost word on the stack; if it is not zero, the code after IF
is executed; if it is zero, the optional code between ELSE and THEN is executed.</dd>
<dt>?DO ... LOOP ( end start -- end counter )</dt>
<dd>Starts a counted loop, the counter taking the value from start to end-1.
Both counter and end values stay on stack while the loop is executed, and
are removed once the loop is done. This is in contrast with traditional Forth,
where loop counter and final value is kept on the return stack. Because of this,
there are no I, J, K words in nForth; instead, use the regular Forth words
for stack manipulations (DUP, OVER or PICK).</dd>
<dt>BEGIN ... UNTIL ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Execute the code between BEGIN and UNTIL; the UNTIL word picks the topmost
word off the stack and examines it; if it is zero, the loop is restarted.
If it is non-zero, the loop finishes.</dd>
<dt>BEGIN ... {WHILE} ... REPEAT ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Execute the loop between BEGIN and WHILE. The WHILE word picks up the top
word and examines it; if it is zero, the part between WHILE and REPEAT is
executed, then loop starts again from BEGIN; if not zero, the loop ends and
execution continues past REPEAT. If WHILE is missing, the loop will never
exit (except with the EXIT or THROW words)</dd>
<dt>DOES&gt; ( -- )</dt>
<dd>This is a very complex word, see topic
<a href="#does">"Clever DATA words: DOES&gt;"</a> for more details.</dd>
<dt>EXIT ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Ends execution of the current word</dd>
<dt>EXECUTE ( whdr -- )</dt>
<dd>Execute the word whose address is on the stack</dd>
<dt>CATCH ( whdr -- n )</dt>
<dd>Execute the word whose address is on the stack and catch any exception
it possibly throws. If words returns normally, a zero is put on the stack;
otherwise the value passed to THROW is left on the stack</dd>
<dt>THROW ( n -- )</dt>
<dd>Throw a exception. Both data and stack pointers are restored to values
that were saved with CATCH; the value passed to THROW is then put again on
the stack and execution continues after the word CATCH</dd>
</dl>

<a name="compilation"></a>
<h3>Compiling new words</h3>

<dl>
<dt>: wordname ... ; ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Create a new word definition. The : word parses another word from input
stream and creates a new indirect-code word with this name. Then it switches
STATE to TRUE (compile mode). The ; word appends an EXIT command to vocabulary,
makes the last word visible (invokes REVEAL) and switches STATE back to FALSE
(interpret mode)</dd>
<dt>WORD ( char -- str )</dt>
<dd>This word takes a separator character from the stack and parses user input
until this separator character is encountered, collecting all encountered
non-separator characters into a string which is returned. A special case is
when separator is a space (' '): in this case a newline is also considered
a separator character. If separator is not a space, some special sequences
are handled: "\n" is translated to a newline character, "\r" to a carriage
return, "\t" to tabulation and "\b" to backspace</dd>
<dt>FIND ( str -- str 0 | whdr -1 | whdr +1 )</dt>
<dd>Look in all active vocabularies for the word with given name. If it is not
found, the name string is left on the stack and a 0 is appended. Otherwise,
the address of word header is put on the stack and a flag is appended - either
-1 if word has the "immediate" execution flag, or +1 if it is a normal word</dd>
<dt>' ( -- whdr )</dt>
<dd>Parse a word from user input and invoke FIND on it; if word is not found,
throw the NFE_UNKNOWN_WORD exception</dd>
<dt>_HDR ( type name -- )</dt>
<dd>Create a new word header in vocabulary. "type" is the word type
(see WHF_TYPE_XXX constants in nf.h)</dd>
<dt>REVEAL ( -- )</dt>
<dd>Add the last defined word to user dictionary. The word will not be found
by FIND until you invoke this word</dd>
<dt>, ( n -- )</dt>
<dd>This word just takes the number on the stack and appends it to last word
definition (to user vocabulary). This is usually a word header address
(e.g. when you're manually building indirect code words)</dd>
<dt>C, ( n -- )</dt>
<dd>Similar to , but appends only one byte to user vocabulary</dd>
<dt>S, ( str -- )</dt>
<dd>Appends to user vocabulary the indirect code that, when executed,
will push the address of a copy of this string. The string is copied
directly into the user vocabulary</dd>
<dt>N, ( n -- )</dt>
<dd>Appends to user vocabulary the indirect code that, when executed,
will push given number on the stack</dd>

<h3>Word types</h3>

<p>nForth uses four different kinds of words: NATIVE, DATA, CODE and DOES,
denoted by two bits in the word header. The four types of words will
<b>EXECUTE</b> differently.
</p>

<ul>
<li><em>NATIVE</em> words will contain native processor code which implement
word functionality. These word executes fastest, but their size is most of the
time also larger (about twice on AVRs) compared to indirect code implementations.
<p>This word type is used to implement the very basic functionality. <b>DROP</b>,
<b>DUP</b>, <b>OVER</b>, arithmetics and many other simple words are NATIVE
words.
</li>
<li><em>CODE</em> words contain indirect code (directly starting after the word
header). Indirect code consists mostly of 16-bit offsets to other words (to
their headers, to be precise). Basically, when <b>EXECUTE</b> executes a CODE
word, it just picks the 16-bit addresses one by one and recursively invokes
<b>EXECUTE</b> with these numbers as argument. As you might have learned in
the <a href="#impdetails">Implementation Details</a> chapter, indirect code
may contain not only offsets to other words but also some special code for
jumps (conditional and unconditional), numeric constants and a few very
special opcodes (<b>EXIT</b> and <b>ICP</b>).
<p>The <b>EXIT</b> code forces the <b>EXECUTE</b> word to return, continuing
execution of the calling word.
</p>
<p>The <b>ICP</b> code will push on the stack the indirect-code-pointer where
execution will be resumed after returning from current word. In other words,
this is the address directly following the indirect code for currently
executing word.
</p>
</li>
<li><em>DATA</em> words contain a single 16-bit pointer to some data area.
The size of this data area is not stored anywhere; you have to know it.
Usually this is just another word in either RAM or EEPROM.
<p>The <b>CREATE</b>, <b>VARIABLE</b>, <b>PVARIABLE</b> words will create
a DATA word. <b>CREATE</b> won't fill the word body with anything; you have
to put a pointer there yourself (with the <b>,</b> word). <b>VARIABLE</b> and
<b>PVARIABLE</b> will allocate space for a 16-bit value with respectively
<b>VALLOT</b> and <b>PALLOT</b>, and append the address of this value to
the created word.
</p>
<p>When a DATA word is <b>EXECUTE</b>d, the 16-bit address from word body
is simply put on the stack. This makes the allocated memory content immediately
available for usage with words like <b>@</b> and <b>!</b>.
</p>
</li>
<li><em>DOES</em> words are described in details in the next section.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clever DATA words: DOES&gt;</h3>

<p>Normal DATA words will just put the address of the allocated space on the
stack. However, you may also set up a DATA word such that some code will be
automatically executed every time when such a word is invoked. For example,
you might want to define a <b>CONST</b> word (similar to VARIABLE)
to create new words which, when invoked, would put not the address of the
allocated space, but directly the word at that address on the stack.
</p>

<p>Let's see how this can be implemented:
</p>

<pre>
: CONST PVARIABLE PHERE ! DOES&gt; @ ;

12 CONST DOZEN
</pre>

<p>The above defines a new word CONST which, when executed, will create a new
persistent variable, then pick the topmost value off the stack and write it
to the latest allocated address in the persistent pool (<b>PHERE</b>). Then
comes the magic word <b>DOES&gt;</b>. What does it mean?
</p>

<p>At the time you invoke the CONST word, execution will break at the
<b>DOES&gt;</b> word. Thus, for the word containing <b>DOES&gt;</b>
it will act just like a regular <b>EXIT</b> word.
</p>

<p>If we would just create a variable named DOZEN, when we would invoke it,
it would leave on the stack the address of some 16-bit space in either RAM
or EEPROM (depending if we created the variable with <b>VARIABLE</b> or
<b>PVARIABLE</b>). But <b>DOES&gt></b> modifies the last defined word
(e.g. DOZEN) such that after pushing the address of the allocated space
the code after <b>DOES&gt;</b> will execute. And that's the fetch word,
<b>@</b>.
</p>

<p>So, when the code <code>12 CONST DOZEN</code> is executed, the following
occurs:
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>PVARIABLE</b>: A DATA word named DOZEN is created, two bytes are allocated with
<b>PALLOC</b>, and a pointer to allocated area is inserted into the
DATA word body.</li>
<li><b>PHERE !</b>: The number on the top of the stack (e.g. 12) is assigned to the
memory we just allocated.</li>
<li><b>DOES&gt;</b>The DOZEN word is modified so that when it executes, the following occurs:</li>
  <ol>
  <li>The word from body is pushed on the stack (e.g. the address of the
  allocated memory).</li>
  <li>The <b>@</b> code is executed, replacing the address of the allocated
  memory with the constant, e.g. 12</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>As a sidenote, there's a clever way to implement the CONST word, but this
is left as a exercice to the reader ;-)
