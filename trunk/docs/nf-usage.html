<h1>Using nForth in your applications</h1>

<p>nForth has been designed to be easily integrated into user applications.
However, you must understand that the basic design idea was
"Forth is the main executing code, and invokes your C code when asked to",
and not vice versa. It could be possible to do so, but there could be
lacking things to use it in such a way.
</p>

<p>Also, nForth has some requirements for the way you compile and link
your code.
<p>

<p>First of all, nForth can be compiled ONLY with the GNU C
compiler (gcc, winavr, mingw32 and other names).
<p>

<p>Second, you must always use the -fno-toplevel-reorder switch,
which prevents the compiler from moving around your functions:
nForth requires that the functions in the executable come
in the absolutely same order as they were defined.
<p>

<p>Third, on non-16-bit architectures you must use a special linker script,
they can be found in libs/nforth/ldscripts/ and there's a README file
there describing how you can create a linker script for your platform.
The reason for using a linker script is to group all Forth words
into a separate section (called .nf-flash), Forth data into another
section called .nf-ram and Forth persistent variables into a third
section called .nf-eeprom. These sections emulates the ROM, RAM
and EEPROM memories on a microcontroller with 16-bit address space.

<h2>A basic Forth interactive console</h2>

<p>Let's look at a very simple Forth application which will implement a
interactive console where user may enter Forth code:
<p>

<pre>
#include "nf.h"

nf_context_t my_ctx;

void nf_app_clean ()
{
}

void nf_app_reset ()
{
    // The global nf_ctx variable should point to the active context
    nf_ctx = &my_ctx;
    // Initialize the nForth context
    nf_reset_ctx (&my_ctx);
    // Set up the active vocabulary for our context
    my_ctx.voc [nfvCore] = NF_CODE2ADDR (&nf_voc_core_inter);
    // Set up the data stack pointer to point to the base of the stack
    nf_dsp = my_ctx.stack;
    // Initialize i/o library (RS232 serial transceiver)
    nf_init_io ();
}

int main (void)
{
    CLEAN ();
    nf_execute (INTERPRET);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Let's look at main() first. The first thing it does is to invoke the
CLEAN() function (NATIVE Forth words may be invoked directly as regular
C functions). This cleans up the microcontroller's EEPROM, calls the
application-defined nf_app_clean() function, and then invokes
the <b>RESET</b> word, which basically sets <b>STATE</b> to <b>FALSE</b>
and then calls the application-defined nf_app_reset() function.
</p>

<p>After <b>CLEAN</b>ing the virtual machine, main() invokes the
nf_execute() macro, which will basically push on the data stack the
address of a nForth word and then invoke <b>EXECUTE</b>. In our case
we will execute the <b>INTERPRET</b> Forth word, which will accept user
input and interpret or compile it.
</p>

<p>You must always define the functions nf_app_clean() and nf_app_reset(),
otherwise your program won't link. Anyways, you will have to implement the
nf_app_reset() function, otherwise the nForth kernel won't function properly.
<p>

<p>The nf_app_clean() function is expected to initialize any EEPROM variables
your application might use to their default states. Since our simple application
does not use any such variables, our nf_app_clean() is empty.
</p>

<p>The nf_app_reset() function is expected to do whatever initialization you
need to do after a <b>RESET</b> of the nForth kernel. Basically, you will want
to initialize all nForth contexts you use and set up the data stack pointer
variable (which is globally held in a register for fast access).

<h2>Writing Forth words in C</h2>

<p>For your application you'll want to provide additional words that will
give access to additional functionality needed. There are two types of Forth
words: native and indirect-code.
</p>

<p>Native words have a standard Forth word header, followed by a machine-code
implementation. Nano-Forth allows writing these implementations in C, thus
enhancing portability, increasing readability while maintaining high effectivity.
</p>

<p>Keep in mind that a native implementation takes about twice as much space as the
equivalent word written in Forth (on AVR, on 64-bit processors the difference is
even bigger).
</p>

<p>Here is a example of a native Forth word:
</p>

<pre>
WORD ("XOR", XOR, WHF_TYPE_NATIVE)
    cell_t arg2 = nf_pop ();
    cell_t arg1 = nf_pop ();
    nf_push (arg1 ^ arg2);
END_WORD
</pre>

<p>As you can see, a native word starts with the WORD macro, which receives three
arguments: the Forth word name, the C word name (which should be a legal C identifier)
and word flags (see WHF_XXX macros in nf.h).
</p>

<p>After that comes the implementation of the word in C, you can use additional macros
and functions from nf.h. The above function should be self-describing.
</p>

<p>Also note that first word in source file must be defined with the macro WORD_1st.
The first word is special in the sense that it does not have a "previous" link
(Forth words are linked in a chain, which is used during a word search).
</p>

<a name="forthinforth"></a>
<h2>Writing Forth words in Forth</h2>

<p>Also nano-Forth allows writing words in a macro language very similar to Forth
itself. In fact, these are Forth indirect codes, just that they are wrapped in
various special macros.
</p>

<p>Here is a typical implementation of a word named MAIN, which can be called
instead of INTERPRET in the example in the previous section:
</p>

<pre>
WORD_CODE_1st ("MAIN", MAIN, WHF_TYPE_CODE, 0)
        CODE_WORD (RESET)
    CODE_LABEL (main_again)
        // INTERPRET never returns except if a exception occurs
        CODE_PUSH_WORD (INTERPRET)
        // Set the catch point here
        CODE_WORD (CATCH)
        CODE_WORD (ERROR)       // :: display the "Exx ..." message
        CODE_JMP (main_again)
END_WORD_CODE
</pre>

<p>The WORD_CODE macro begins the declaration of a Forth indirect-code word
(unlike WORD, which starts a native word definition).
The word body is equivalent to the following Forth code:
</p>

<pre>
: MAIN RESET BEGIN [ ' INTERPRET N, ] CATCH ERROR REPEAT ;
</pre>

<a name="appdic"></a>
<h2>Application-specific dictionary</h2>

<p>Your application can define many additional words, which all will go into
the nfvCore dictionary. To append your own words to existing core dictionary,
you must use the last parameter to the WORD_1st or WORD_CODE_1st, which is the
link to previous word in chain.
</p>

<p>All you have to do is to link the first word of your dictionary to one of the
existing dictionaries (nf_voc_core, nf_voc_core_io or nf_voc_core_inter), like this:
</p>

<pre>
WORD_CODE_1st ("MAIN", MAIN, WHF_TYPE_CODE, _NF_ASMNAME (nf_voc_core_inter) - __CODE_BASE)
</pre>

<p>Then you must define your own dictionary. <em>Before</em> the definition of the
last word in your vocabulary, you must invoke the following macro:
</p>

<pre>
VOCABULARY (nf_voc_xxxxx);
</pre>

<p>Finally, when initializing the Forth context in nf_app_reset(), don't forget to
put the address of the dictionary in the context:
</p>

<pre>
my_ctx.voc [nfvCore] = NF_CODE2ADDR (&nf_voc_xxxxx);
</pre>
