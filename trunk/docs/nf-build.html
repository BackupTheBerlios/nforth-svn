<h1>Building the nano-Forth kernel</h1>

<p>The project is using a build system named TIBS - "The Instant Build System".
This is to emphasize the fact that it's way faster than traditional autoconf :)
However, you'll have to spend a little time understanding how it works and
how it can be used.
</p>

<p>Also note that I do all my developement on a 64-bit Linux platform, so if
your platform is different, you may encounter various obstacles I didn't know
about. Most of the time, though, they're quite easy to solve: if you can't,
just mail me and we'll try to solve them together.
</p>

<a name="requirements"></a>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To successfuly build and use the nano-Forth kernel, you will need the following
tools:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>GNU Make 3.81 or later</dt>
<dd>TIBS uses features of GNU Make version 3.81 and later</dd>
<dt>avr-gcc</dt>
<dd>nano-Forth is highly dependent on gcc features - you will not be able
to build it with anything else</dd>
</dl>

<p>Unfortunately, nano-Forth needs support for 8-bit relocations in object file format.
This support was missing until February 2010, I have
<a href="http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11297">submitted a patch which
has been applied to binutils trunk</a>. If your binutils are older, you will have
to patch and compile binutils (download the patch from the link above) on your own.
</p>

<a name="sourcetree"></a>
<h2>Source tree structure</h2>

<p>Source tree is layed out as follows:
</p>

<pre>
docs/           The directory with documentation
include/        Public header files, private header files are in the
                directory of the module where they are used.
libs/           The libraries are all here, every library in a separate
                subdirectory.
apps/           Applications, every application in its own subdirectory.
tibs/           The Instant Build System makefiles.
out/            Autocreated directory, contains compiled object files,
                libraries, executables and in general, everything generated
                during the build process.
</pre>

<a name="configuring"></a>
<h2>Configuring the kernel</h2>

<p>Before building the nano-Forth kernel you must configure its basic features.
There are a few settings you can tweak in <code>include/nf/nf-defs.h</code>.
For a first-time try the default values are reasonable.
</p>

<p>Now you must decide for which architecture you will build. For your first try
I'd recommend to build a x86_64 version, you can build the <code>fcon</code> application
and interactively try the Forth kernel to see what it can do. Unfortunately, due to
some limitations of object file formats you will not be able to build nano-Forth for
a x86 target: this partially works on Linux but the resulting executable can be run
only as root (because executable will contain some code at offset zero, which is
prohibited for users without administrative capabilities). There are no such
limits on the x86_64 platform.
</p>

<p>To select the architecture you want to build for, open <code>local-config.mak</code>
and locate the <b>TARG</b> variable. Set it to one of the values listed in comment.
</p>

<a name="buildfcon"></a>
<h2>Building an application</h2>

<p>Now run <code>make</code>. You will see a list of targets that can be built.
Run <code>make fcon</code> to build the interactive Forth console application.
If everything goes fine, you will have at the end a executable file
out/linux.x86_64/debug/fcon, which you can run now.
</p>

<p>There is some nano-Forth test code in <code>tests/nf</code> which you may try.
It is meant to test various aspects of the kernel, it's not a programming example.
However, it may help you to get the basic ideas of how to use nForth.
</p>

<a name="flashing"></a>
<h2>Making a ROM image and flashing</h2>

<p>If you want to build an AVR ROM image and flash it into your developement board,
it is easy. First, set <b>TARG</b> in <code>local-config.mak</code> to <b>avr</b>.
Now build the <code>fcon</code> application just like described above. In the end,
you will get a ELF executable named out/avr.avr/release/fcon. You can flash it
now automatically by invoking:
</p>

<pre>
make flash-fcon
</pre>

<p>This will invoke the script <code>tibs/extra/flash-elf.awk</code>, which will
flash your ELF file into your debug board using avrdude. You can tweak avrdude
parameters in <code>local-config.mak</code> in the <b>AVR-GCC.FLASHFLAGS</b>
variable.
</p>

<p>If you prefer the old way of doing it, you will have to convert the ELF
file into a .hex file as usual with avr-objcopy.
